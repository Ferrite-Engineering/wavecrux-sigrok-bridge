"""check-no-private-references — this public repository points at nothing a
reader cannot open.

WHY THIS EXISTS

This repository is public, and has been since before the suite's open-core
flip. Its readers have this repository, the WaveCrux open core, the published
pages on edacrux.app, and nothing else. A doc that justifies a choice by
citing a section of an unpublished plan, a comment naming a closed repository
path, or a Cargo description carrying a roadmap phase number is a dead end for
every one of them — and a quiet disclosure of how the closed half of the suite
is laid out.

All three shapes were really here, live and public: README.md and
docs/ARCHITECTURE.md named the closed Pro overlay repository, CLAUDE.md cited
a `<product>-pro/docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md` checkbox, and "Phase 4.1" appeared in
the shim's published Cargo description. Eighteen occurrences across nine
files were rewritten when this script was added. Nothing had stopped them;
this script is what stops the next one.

THE RULE

State the reason in place, or cite something the reader can open: a file in
this repository, a page on edacrux.app, or WaveCrux's published docs site.

WHAT IS SCANNED

Every file `git ls-files` reports: Rust, docs, ADRs, Cargo manifests,
workflows and tool scripts, comments and string literals alike. A Cargo
description is published to crates.io, so it is held to the same bar.
Skipped: this script — see below — `Cargo.lock` (resolver output, not prose),
files whose first bytes are not text, and files over _MAX_BYTES, which here
means capture fixtures.

WHY THE PATTERNS READ ODDLY

This file is public, and a rule table that spells out every private
repository's name IS the disclosure it exists to prevent — a list of
unannounced products, published in a regex. So each sensitive literal is
broken by a regex construct that still matches it: `crux-upd(?:ates)` matches
the update Worker's repository name, but a search of this file for that name
finds nothing. The planted samples below are assembled from fragments for the
same reason — a string literal would re-publish what the pattern hides. The
script is excluded from its own scan anyway, but the exclusion is there so
the rules do not match themselves, not as permission to publish the list.

THE ALLOWLIST

_ALLOWLIST names one exact path and the exact rules it is exempt from, with
the reason. It is empty by design, and an entry that stops matching anything
fails the run, so it cannot rot into a set of standing holes.

USAGE
